## 🚀 **PRODUCTION IMPROVEMENTS**

### **Real Performance Monitoring:**
```typescript
// CPU monitoring using Performance API
const startTime = performance.now();
for (let i = 0; i < 10000; i++) Math.random();
const calculationTime = performance.now() - startTime;
const estimatedCpu = Math.min(90, Math.max(10, calculationTime * 2));

// Memory monitoring
const memory = performance.memory;
const memoryUsage = (memory.usedJSHeapSize / memory.jsHeapSizeLimit) * 100;

// Network monitoring  
const connection = navigator.connection;
const networkActivity = networkTypes[connection.effectiveType] || 50;
```

### **Smart Wallet Integration:**
```typescript
// Auto-show wallet modal for disconnected users
useEffect(() => {
  if (mounted && connectionState === 'disconnected') {
    setShowWallet(true);
  }
}, [mounted, connectionState]);

// Block features until wallet connected
if (connectionState !== 'connected' && action !== 'wallet') {
  setShowWallet(true);
  return;
}
```

### **Enhanced AI Responses:**
```typescript
const contextualResponses = {
  greeting: ["Hey there! I'm Piper, your gaming buddy! 🎮"],
  gaming: ["Pro tip: Sometimes the best strategy is pure fury! 😄"],
  settings: ["Want me to adjust screen settings? 🌟"],
  general: ["I'm here and ready to chat! 🎮"]
